# fbm3d
fbm3d is a code that generates a lognormal or Gaussian random field using the fractional Brownian motion algorithm, designed to mimic the density field in the interstellar medium.
The detailed algorithms are described in Seon (2012) and Lewis & Austin (2002).
See example.ipynb and example2.ipynb for examples of how to use the code.
